About Me

Originally from North Vancouver, I spent two years in Ontario studying Geology at Queen’s University before completing my Bachelor of Environment in Resource and Environmental Management (REM) at Simon Fraser University. During my undergraduate studies, my existing interests in biology, geology, and physical geography were transformed into a passion for visual scientific communication, and I became particularly fascinated by the unparalleled ability of mapping to illustrate relationships in the natural world. As a varsity rower with UBC, a coach, and a Kayak Instructor in Deep Cove/səl̓ilw̓ət, I’m chronically outdoors and have a keen interest in Water Rights, stewardship, and conservation. After completing the MGEM program, I would like to earn my P.Ag and pursue a career in environmental consulting, specialising in GIS. In my spare time, you can find me rowing (unsurprisingly), running, and playing board games.
